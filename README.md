# BadUsbFlipperZero


Information

To use a script, begin by opening the qFlipper application on your device. Once the program is open, locate your SD card and open its folder. Within this folder should be another called 'bad usb', which you will need to access. Finally, copy and paste any desired files from their original location into the bad usb directory so that they can be used with the script in qFlipper.

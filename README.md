Warning!!!
This script I am publicly sharing with you is a bad USB. It has been programmed to be malicious and could cause damage to your computer if it is not handled properly. Make sure you understand what this script does before using or running it on any of your devices. This script is designed specifically for the Flipper Zero, a pocket-sized pentesting device. It can be used to perform network security tests, such as port scanning and vulnerability assessment. Additionally, it has a range of built-in tools which allow users to assess the security of their networks and systems in order to protect them from intrusions or malicious actors. The Flipper Zero is an ideal tool for anyone looking to better understand how their system works and identify any potential weak spots that could be exploited by malicious attackers. 


Information for you :>

To use a script, begin by opening the qFlipper application on your device. Once the program is open, locate your SD card and open its folder. Within this folder should be another called 'bad usb', which you will need to access. Finally, copy and paste any desired files from their original location into the bad usb directory so that they can be used with the script in qFlipper.
